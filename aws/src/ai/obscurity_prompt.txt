Evaluate Familiarity and Categorize Words and Phrases

For each input word or phrase, which will likely be in ALLCAPS and without spaces (e.g., "SNOWFORT"), perform the following steps:

Step 1: Parse and Normalize
- Convert the input to standard capitalization and spacing (e.g., "SNOWFORT" becomes "snow fort").
- Attempt multiple parsings if ambiguous (e.g., "ITSAGO" could be "it's a go" or "it's ago", "AMSTEREO" could be "AM stereo").
- Crucially, select the interpretation that yields the highest familiarity score while strictly using the exact letters provided. You can only change capitalization, spacing, and punctuation. Do not add, remove, or assume additional letters.

Step 2: Categorize: Assign the parsed word/phrase to one of the following categories:
- Word: Single words (e.g., "quixotic"), including contractions (e.g. I've)
- Derived Word: A word formed from another word (e.g., "diving" from "dive", "pillars" from "pillar")
- Phrase: Multiple words forming a recognized unit (e.g., "snow fort," "give to"). This includes verb-preposition phrases only if the preposition commonly pairs with the verb.
- Brand Name: (e.g., "Camelbak")
- Proper Name: Names of specific people, places, or things (e.g., "Tiger Woods," "Mr. Ed").
- Acronym: (e.g., "ESPY", "SSN").
- Abbreviation: A shortened form of a word or phrase (e.g., "attn.," "ctr."). Only use if the abbreviation is less common than the original (e.g., "amp" would be "Word" as it's more common than "ampere"). Also consider plural abbreviations ("ATCs").
- Prefix/Suffix: (e.g., "tri-," "-ose"). Score based on the familiarity of the prefix/suffix itself.
- Incoherent: Phrases that do not form a recognized unit or words that are nonsensical (e.g., "snow tag," "xoner"). Incoherent items automatically score 0.

Step 3: Score Familiarity: Assign a score from 0 to 5 based on the following rubric. Consider the word/phrase's common usage, frequency, specificity, and general recognition among native English speakers.
5 - Basic Building Blocks: Fundamental, daily-use words that are taught in beginner English classes.
Examples: sit, else, gone, tree, my
4.5 - Extremely Common: Frequently encountered in everyday conversations. No contractions or abbreviations above a 4.
Examples: oil, song, usual, boss, ones, own
4 - Very Common: Well known and in almost eveyone's active vocabulary.
Examples: attic, comma, period, bark, toast, dinosaurs, I've, give to
3.5 - Quite Common: Likely recognized by most educated speakers, but not necessarily in everyone's active vocabulary.
Examples: bio's, pillars, matchmaker, boost, tuba, sentiment, Tiger Woods, give to
3 - Common: Generally known but more specific in usage, or less frequent. Includes many common acronyms, proper nouns, and commonly understood conjugated/derived words. This is the default home for everything that is otherwise unremarkable.
Examples: SSN, oboe, coop, bento, tres, mac, deuce, THC, BTU, USSR, stage name, U-boat, decor, D-list, ID'ed, ensue, master gardener, snow fort, ESPY, abbr., tri-, amp
2.5 - Somewhat Familiar/Niche: Familiar to certain groups or contexts, but not universally recognized.
Examples: udon, e-cig, midis, Elio, accede, attn.
2 - Limited Familiarity: Known to a smaller segment of the population (specialized fields, specific cultural references).
Examples: Elle, Moondance, Manu, Mekong, quixotic, Mr. Ed, ATCs
1.5 - Very Limited Familiarity: Generally obscure, known only in very specific contexts or by a small number of people.
Examples: tsars, ade, plagioclase, Ilana, Erivo, ctr., -ose
1 - Extremely Rare/Obscure: Almost entirely unknown to the general public.
Examples: Marli Miller, Cantor Set, six seconds
0.5 - Unused
0 - Unrecognizable/Nonsensical: Not recognized as legitimate words/phrases, or are typos/misspellings. Also assigned to "Incoherent" category.
Examples: pink witch, xoner, classikal, roo's crossing, snow tag
