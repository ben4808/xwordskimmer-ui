Evaluate Familiarity and Categorize Words and Phrases

For each input word or phrase, which will likely be in ALLCAPS and without spaces (e.g., "SNOWFORT"), perform the following steps:

Step 1: Parse and Normalize
- Convert the input to standard capitalization and spacing (e.g., "SNOWFORT" becomes "snow fort").
- Attempt multiple parsings if ambiguous (e.g., "ITSAGO" could be "it's a go" or "it's ago", "AMSTEREO" could be "AM stereo").
- Crucially, select the interpretation that yields the highest familiarity score while strictly using the exact letters provided. You can only change capitalization, spacing, and punctuation. Do not add, remove, or assume additional letters.

Step 2: Categorize: Assign the parsed word/phrase to one of the following categories:
- Word: Single words (e.g., "quixotic"), including contractions (e.g. I've). Include online slang even if it's not officially a word.
- Derived Word: A word formed from another word (e.g., "diving" from "dive", "pillars" from "pillar"). Conjugated verbs. Score based on the familiarity of the derived form -- some derived forms are more common than the base word, and some are barely used.
- Phrase: Multiple words forming a recognized unit (e.g., "snow fort," "give to", "watch your step"). This includes verb-preposition phrases only if the preposition commonly pairs with the verb. Take into account that many phrases can be readily understood even if the persons hasn't seen them before. Include online slang even if it's not official.
- Brand Name: (e.g., "Camelbak")
- Proper Name: Names of specific people, places, or things (e.g., "Tiger Woods," "Mr. Ed"). Consider solo first names or last names (e.g. "Idris", "Robbie").
- Acronym: (e.g., "ESPY", "SSN", "LGA").
- Abbreviation: A shortened form of a word or phrase (e.g., "attn.," "ctr."). Only use if the abbreviation is less common than the original (e.g., "amp" would be "Word" as it's more common than "ampere"). Also consider plural abbreviations ("ATCs").
- Prefix/Suffix: (e.g., "tri-," "-ose"). Score based on the familiarity of the prefix/suffix itself.
- Incoherent: Phrases that do not form a recognized unit or words that are nonsensical (e.g., "snow tag," "xoner"). Incoherent items automatically score 0.

Step 3: Score Familiarity: Assign a score from 0 to 5 based on the following rubric. Consider familiarity among native English speakers. Calibrate based on the examples given at each level.
5 - Extremely fundamental. These are among the first few words learned. No contractions, abbreviations, or acronyms.
Examples: sit, else, gone, tree, my, thank you, red, less, year
4.5 - Extremely common but not fundamental. Extremely common phrases. No contractions, abbreviations, or acronyms.
Examples: oil, song, normal, boss, ones, own, go ahead, come on, comma, toast, star, hobby, trip
4 - Very Common. In practically everyone's active vocabulary. Very common phrases. The most common contractions, abbreviations, and acronyms.
Examples: attic, bark, dinosaurs, I've, social media, water bottle, gasp, sleep in, SOS, beat it, etc., OK, scarce
3.5 - Quite Common: In the active vocabulary of most but not all. Readily understood phrases (even if they aren't in active vocabulary). Well-known names.
Examples: thrive, cash register, caw, speed trap, malaria, photo booth, alias, AOL, abbr., lol, ASAP, SNL, Jimmy Kimmel, Ben
3 - Recognized by the majority of speakers, but not neccessarily in active vocabulary. Some well-known foreign words. Common names. Easy trivia.
Examples: SSN, bento, tres, deuce, THC, BTU, USSR, stage name, U-boat, D-list, ID'ed, master gardener, attn., tri-, Big Data, box score, eagled, Melinda, contrite, dear sir, souffle, orcs, Deuteronomy
2.5 - Recognized by many but not the majority. Less common derivatives. Less common synonyms. Slightly niche. Less common single names. Moderate trivia.
Examples: udon, e-cig, midis, Elio, accede, event horizon, si si, avow, slier, Emil, disused, REM, girl scout camp, acerbic, Alp, b-days, quixotic, cad
2 - Limited Familiarity: Known to a smaller segment of the population. Harder trivia. Rare names. Abbreviations not often used. Maybe niche to a specific field. Partial phrases that aren't often seen on their own.
Examples: Elle, Moondance, Manu, Mekong, persiflage, Mr. Ed, ATCs, Aaron Burr, moment of inertia, Peak TV, Goa, Emerson, Apso, Lipa, tatterdemalion
1.5 - Generally obscure, known only in very specific contexts. Obscure alternative spellings. Too obscure to make good trivia. Partials that don't work on their own. Rarely used abbreviations. Verb forms almost never seen. Super technical terms. 
Examples: tsars, ade, plagioclase, Ilana, Erivo, ctr., -ose, Gaussian distribution, OR docs, meeter, Nomo, Entebbe, Sao, tra-las, cdr.
1 - Extremely Rare/Obscure: Almost entirely unknown to the general public. Info is available on the Internet, but everyone has to look it up.
Examples: Marli Miller, Cantor Set, six seconds, Three Forks
0.5 - Unused
0 - Unrecognizable/Nonsensical: Not recognized as legitimate words/phrases, or are obviously erroneous typos/misspellings. Assigned to "Incoherent" category.
Examples: pink witch, xoner, classikal, roo's crossing, snow tag
