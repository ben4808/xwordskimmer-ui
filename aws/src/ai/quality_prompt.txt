Rank the provided words and phrases based on their quality according to the provided rubric.

Score incoherent words and phrases as 0. A phrase is incoherent unless it forms a recognized unit (e.g., "green thumb" is valid, "blue thumb" is not, "snow tag" is not because it's just unrelated words). Verb-preposition phrases are valid only if the preposition commonly pairs with the verb.

Rubric:

5: "Iconic"	 Universally familiar and triggers a burst of positive feeling or anticipation.
Examples: "save the date", "trick or treat", "you had me at hello", "the American dream"

4.5: "Beloved"  Very familiar and warmly evocative, but either the audience is a bit narrower or the emotion slightly less intense than a 5.
Examples: "father of the bride", "Cybertruck", "private jet", "sibling rivalry"

4: "Warm"  Readily recognized by most people and carries a pleasant, fun, or flavorful vibe.
Examples: "PJs", "wedding dress", "sashay", "dill pickle", "thank you"

3.5 "Interesting" Common enough and has an extra hook—edge, science vibe, playful sound, etc.—without universal warmth. Has a mild emocional charge.
Examples: "hadron", "cock", "twerps", "X-ray lab", "madly", "sleeping bag"

3: “Neutral / Everyday”	 Straight‑up standard English (or well‑known brand/abbrev.) with little emotional color.	This is the default home for things dificult to categorize otherwise.
• You’d see it in news or casual talk 
• Neither strongly positive nor off‑putting	
• Could be offsetting positive and negative aspects
Examples: "law", "orca", "lei", "Sony", "unit", "abuela", "MBA", "NATO"

2.5: “Dated / Slightly Off"  Understandable but feels archaic, partial, mildly awkward, or mildly unfamiliar.
Examples: "arose" ("got up" is more natural), "tare" (not very familiar), "Seuss" ("Dr. Seuss" is much better), "something old" (start of popular wedding poem but awkward by itself), "bedroom door" (nothing special about the bedroom door over any other door)

2: "Obscure but Legit"  Correct English yet only a niche group would know or use it; limited emotional pull. Looks or sounds “meh” to general reader. Too many of these make a crossword less enjoyable.
Examples: "latke", "Priam", "enrapt", "a la", "inter"

1.5: “Trivial / Icky / Very Obscure”  Requires highly specialized knowledge, is "icky" to say, or doesn't cohere well. Evokes “Huh?” or mild distaste or "what's that?". Non-standard spellings.
Examples: "Lendl", "LGA", "NEA", "teenie", "eeler", "a word?"

1 “Barely Coherent”  Fragment, archaic exclamation, or malformed construction—native speakers hesitate.	Might feel like a typo or mangled syntax. Might be a partial phrases that makes no sense on its own.
Examples: "O woe", "Can't I?", "etat", "ATT"

0.5: Unused. Anything below 1 scores a 0.

0: Not a Thing/Incoherent: Not recognized in English, misspelled or impossible construction
Examples: "grusm", "blue thumb"
