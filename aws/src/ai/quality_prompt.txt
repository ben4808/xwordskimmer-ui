Rate the quality of words and phrases

If the word/phrase is incoherent, immediately score it as 0. These are phrases that do not form a recognized unit (e.g. "green thumb" forms a recognized unit, "blue thumb" does not) or words that are nonsensical (e.g., "xoner," "gsuem"). Verb-preposition phrases are valid only if the preposition commonly pairs with the verb.

Assign a score based on quality according to the provided rubric. Calibrate responses based on the provided examples at each level.

How to score in practice:
The default score is a 3 and the score deviates from there based on the following factors:

Desirable qualities that raise the baseline above 3:
• Sparks joy
• Rich, vivid imagery or cultural story 
• Is likely to spark conversation, perhaps causing people to tell stories or share opinions.
• Evokes positive memories, humor, or sensory appeal.
• Is fun to say, looks cool, or alludes to something people find cool.
• Is interesting, might inspire people to look it up and learn more.
• Is very topical

Undesirable qualties that subtract from the baseline (these can stack):
• If very few people can recognize it, subtract 1. If it is unfamiliar to the majority of people, subtract .5.
• Is less than 6 letters long. This doesn't subtract points but makes it harder to raise the baseline.
• Is a single word. This doesn't subtract points but makes it harder to raise the baseline.
• Carries a negative connotation or sounds close to a word with negative connotation or a swear word. Subtract .5
• Is a derived word instead of a base word, and the derived word is significantly less common than the base word. Subtract .5
• Is an abbreviation or acronym or contraction that is significantly less common than the full version. Subtract .5
• Is a partial phrase where the full phrase is much more common. Subtract .5
• Is a single name, rather than a full name ("Bill" rather than "Bill Gates"). Subtract .5
• There are better/more common ways to say the same thing. Subtract .5

Rubric:

5: "Iconic"	- Embodies almost every desirable quality. It's hard to achieve this level.
Examples: save the date, trick or treat, you had me at hello, the American dream

4.5: "Beloved" - Embodies many desirable qualities 
Examples: father of the bride, Cybertruck, private jet, sibling rivalry, game on!, bromance

4: "Warm" - Embodies some desirable qualities 
Examples: PJs, wedding dress, dill pickle, thank you, it's a go!, and done!, beat it, on a tear

3.5 "Interesting" - Embodies at least one desirable quality
Examples: hadron, twerps, X-ray lab, madly, sleeping bag, sashay, malaria, dairy farm, souffle, Peak TV

3: “Nothing special" - Either have neither positive or negative qualities or has both that are cancelling each other out
Examples: law, orca, lei, Sony, unit, abuela, MBA, NATO, Goa, cock, burrs, Abel, enamor, herb garden, cash register, ochre

2.5: Embodies probably 1 negative quality
Examples: "tare" (not very familiar), "Seuss" ("Dr. Seuss" is much better), "puss" (close to "pussy"), "si si" (foreign and not a common contruction), "Alp" ("Alps" is much more common), disused (not very familiar), "b-days" ("birthdays" is better), "slier" (not a common derivation), "Apso" ("Lhasa Apso" is better), "Tasha" (single name, which Tasha are we talking about?), "IRAs" (not common as a plural), "REM" ("REM sleep" is usuall said), "sits pat", ("stands pat" is better)

2: Embodies multiple negative qualities. Or is so obscure almost nobody recognizes what it is.
Examples: latke, Priam, enrapt, a la, inter, ole, meeter, Sahl, tra-las, OR docs, Nomo, Sao, Entebbe, oneg, nae

1.5: Would otherwise be a 2 but has an extra negative quality. Very obscure plus a negative quality.
Examples: Lendl, maa, att.

1 Barely coherent. Fragment, archaic exclamation, or malformed construction—native speakers hesitate. Might feel like a typo or mangled syntax. Might be a partial phrases that makes no sense on its own.
Examples: "O woe", "Can't I?"

0.5: Unused. Anything below 1 scores a 0.

0: Not a Thing/Incoherent
Examples: "grusm", "blue thumb", "xoner"
