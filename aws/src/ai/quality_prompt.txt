Rank the provided words and phrases based on their quality according to the provided rubric. The bullet points in the rubric should be interpreted as guidelines rather than absolutes.

Score incoherent words and phrases (e.g., "snow tag" as unrelated words) as 0. A phrase is incoherent unless it forms a recognized unit (e.g., "green thumb" is valid, "blue thumb" is not). Verb-preposition phrases are valid only if the preposition commonly pairs with the verb.

Generally non-infinitive verbs and archaic forms should score 0.5 less than their canonical forms unless the derived forms are very common.

Full names should be preferred to only first names or only last names. Full names should score 0.5 point higher and single names 0.5 lower (unless it's a common generic name).

Rubric:

5: "Iconic"	 Universally familiar and triggers a burst of positive feeling or anticipation.
• Instantly recognizable to almost any adult 
• Rich, vivid imagery or cultural story 
• Stands alone—no context needed 
• Nearly no negative baggage
Examples: "save the date", "trick or treat", "you had me at hello", "the American dream"

4.5: "Beloved"  Very familiar and warmly evocative, but either the audience is a bit narrower or the emotion slightly less intense than a 5.
• Cultural touchstone (weddings, holidays, classic films, etc.) 
• Clear, upbeat associations
• Instantly recognizable to almost any adult 
Examples: "father of the bride", "Cybertruck", "private jet", "sibling rivalry"

4: "Warm"  Readily recognized by most people and carries a pleasant, fun, or flavorful vibe.
• Evokes positive memories, humor, or sensory appeal 
Examples: "PJs", "wedding dress", "sashay", "dill pickle", "thank you"

3.5 "Interesting" Common enough and has an extra hook—edge, science vibe, playful sound, etc.—without universal warmth.
• Multiple meanings, clever sound, topical field 
• Mild emotional charge (curiosity, excitement)	
Examples: "hadron", "cock", "twerps", "X-ray lab", "madly", "sleeping bag"

3: “Neutral / Everyday”	 Straight‑up standard English (or well‑known brand/abbrev.) with little emotional color.	
• You’d see it in news or casual talk 
• Neither strongly positive nor off‑putting	
• Offsetting positive and negative aspects
Examples: "law", "orca", "lei", "Sony", "unit", "abuela", "MBA", "NATO"

2.5: “Dated / Slightly Off"  Understandable but feels archaic, partial, mildly awkward, or mildly unfamiliar.
• Small negative connotation
• There might more lively ways to the say the same thing
• Normal phrases without great coherence (e.g. "bedroom door" could easily be "<any room> door")
Examples: "arose", "tare", "Seuss", "something old", "bedroom door"

2: "Obscure but Legit"  Correct English yet only a niche group would know or use it; limited emotional pull.
• Foreign loanword, minor mythology, niche food 
• Looks or sounds “meh” to general reader
• Too many of these make a crossword less enjoyable
Examples: "latke", "Priam", "enrapt", "a la", "inter"

1.5: “Trivial / Icky / Very Obscure”  Requires highly specialized knowledge, is "icky" to say, or doesn't cohere well
• Airport codes, agencies, little‑known names
• Evokes “Huh?” or mild distaste
Examples: "Lendl", "LGA", "NEA", "teenie", "eeler", "a word?"

1 “Barely Coherent”  Fragment, archaic exclamation, or malformed construction—native speakers hesitate.	
• Requires missing words 
• Feels like a typo or mangled syntax
Examples: "O woe", "Can't I?", "etat", "ATT"

0.5: Unused. Anything below 1 score a 0.

0: Not a Thing/Incoherent: Not recognized in English, misspelled or impossible construction
Examples: "grusm", "anyum"


How to Rate in Practice:

1. Familiarity first
- Ask “Would an average high‑school‑educated adult in the U.S. immediately know this?”
- Yes → Base in the 3–5 range.
- Maybe → 2-2.5.
- Probably not → 0-1.5.

2. Length
- Multi-word phrase that stays vivid and lively: bump up 0.5-1
- Short word (5 letters or less): keep or drop 0.5

3. Emotional / imagistic pull
- Strong positive memories or excitement: bump up 0.5–1.
- Neutral: leave as is.
- Negatively tinted or "icky": drop 0.5.

4. Completeness & clarity
- Full standalone concept (noun phrase, verb, etc.)? keep.
- Non-infinitive verb, archaic form? subtract 0.5
- Partial phrase, non-integral prefixes/suffixes ("re-learn" "jumpy-ness")? subtract 0.5.
- Acronym or abbreviation that's not common said (e.g. MBA and GPS are commonly said, but "abbr." isn't said, "abbreviation" is pronounced)? subtract 0.5

5. Aesthetic & intrigue
- Fun sound, clever double meaning, topical edge? add 0.5.
- Looks weird/ugly or hard to parse or hard to say/understand? subtract 0.5.

5. Sanity check against the rubric
- Compare the working score's description with the table; nudge to the nearest description that "feels right."
