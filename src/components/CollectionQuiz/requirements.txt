Tech Stack: React + TypeScript, SCSS Modules, Dark Mode UI, Google OAuth (JWT).

Data Loading: 
- Fetch clues via getCollectionBatch API. Initial batch: <= 20 clues. 
- Next batch pre-loads in background when user reaches the LAST CLUE of the current batch.
- API Response Schema: Will be returned as an array of Clue objects.

Layout
1. Session Score Boxes (Top, Side-by-Side)
  - Correct Count: Dark green border/background.
  - Incorrect Count: Dark red border/background.

2. Progress Bar (If Logged In)
  - Scope: Current clue only.
  - Visuals: A single bar with no labels. Gray backgound, green progress based on the proportion of correct answers against correct answers needed. 
      
3. Non-Crossword Mode (isCrosswordCollection = false)
- Clue Text Source (Priority):
   1. Custom clue text (custom_clue) if present.
   2. Random example sentence (use translation in language of clue)
- Expected Answer Source (Priority)
   1. If the clue has a custom display text, that is the expected response.
   2. If clue text has fill-in-the-black section (text inside double brackets), the expected response is the text inside the brackets.
      The clue text here refers to whichever clue text source was chosen.
   3. Otherwise, the expected response is the Entry's display text.
- Input Area
   - If FITB section: Input box replaces the placeholder inline.
   - Otherwise, input box appears below the clue text and translated clue.
- Input Sizing: Input box width dynamically adapts to the length of the expected response text.
   - Should use the getTextWidth function in lib/utils.ts to calculate.
- Translated Clue: Shown in smaller text below the main clue ONLY when an example sentence is used (i.e., NO custom clue).
- Input Box Validation:
   - Function: lib/utils.ts/verifyInputBox (returns Completed, Partial, or Incorrect)
   - Trigger: After every keystroke.
   - Feedback: Text turns solid dark green when validation returns "Partial", solid dark red on "Incorrect". On "Completed", the text turns solid
       dark green and the background turns a very dark green.
       
4. Crossword Mode (isCrosswordCollection = true)
- Clue Text: Displays custom clue text. (these clues will always have a custom clue)
- Input Boxes: One box per alphanumeric character (A-Z, 0-9). Special chars/spaces displayed as static text.
- Navigation: Click a box to activate; Typing replaces letter and advances; Backspace clears and moves back; Arrow keys navigate.
- Visual Feedback: Letter color changes (dark green/dark red) per box. All boxes turn solid dark green background when all correct.

5. Action Buttons & Flow
- Reveal button. Visible when the clue has not been Completed. Trigger: Button click OR Enter key.
  - Increments Incorrect score. Displays correct answer in input box, which will in turn show Next and Explain.
  - Upon successful completion without using the Reveal button, the Correct score in incremented.
- Next button. Visible after Reveal or Successful Completion. Trigger: Button click OR Enter key.
  - Loads next clue from batch. 
- Explain button. Visible alongside the Next button. Trigger: Button click.
  - Copies AI explanation prompt to clipboard. The prompt lives at /explain_prompt.txt.

6. Notes
- The clues should be shown in the order that they are returned from getCollectionBatch. New batches should be seamlessly
  tacked onto the end of the last batch.
- Every time a new clue is shown, the size of the input box should be recalculated based on the new expected response.
